# Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz

This project is part of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum focused on learning accessibility. It demonstrates how to create a quiz that is accessible to all users, including those who use assistive technologies.

## Project Overview

The main goals of this project are to:
- Develop a quiz using HTML and CSS
- Apply accessibility principles to ensure the quiz is usable by a wide audience
- Gain practical experience in accessible web design

## Features

- **Semantic HTML**: The project uses semantic elements to improve the structure and meaning of the HTML code.
- **Accessible Labels**: Each input element has a label for screen readers and other assistive devices.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: The quiz is designed to be fully navigable using only a keyboard.
- **Contrast Ratios**: Ensures that text has sufficient contrast against background colors for readability.
- **ARIA Roles**: Uses ARIA attributes where necessary to improve accessibility for assistive technologies.

## Technologies Used
